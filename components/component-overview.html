                            <p>Components are broken into three main categories:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pathway components</li>
                                <li>Content components</li>
                                <li>Menu components</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            
                            <h3>Pathway components</h3>
                            <p>Pathways are the primary method of in-page navigation, they promote a link to another page or website as a tile within the context of the page. They include include a summary of content and purpose.</p>
                            
                            
                            <h4>Displaying multiple pathways as a list</h4>
                            <p>Components that include list in the name display a grid of multiple pathways, each tile is added as an item in the one component. The display of every component is treated the same across the entire list, eg if you choose to hide the description it will be hidden across every component.</p>
                            
                            
                            <h3>Content components</h3>
                            <p>Content components format in-page copy and imagery to present the content as clearly as possible for the user.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Menu components</h3>
                            <p>Menu components enable the user to easily navigate through business.gov.au site or tools.</p>
